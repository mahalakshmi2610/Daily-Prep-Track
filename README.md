# ðŸ’¼ Job-Ready Track â€“ Day-wise Prep for Interviews

Welcome to my daily preparation journey for becoming job-ready. This repository contains hands-on practice in DSA (Java), Python scripting, SQL, and core CS concepts â€” tracked and organized by day.

---

## ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ Summary

**âœ… Tasks Completed:**
- Solved 3 DSA problems in Java:
  - Reverse Array
  - Move Zeros
  - Two Sum
- Revised core OS concept: Process vs Thread (with real-world analogy)
- Performed Python scripting using `pandas`:
  - Filtering, grouping, and date-based analysis on online orders dataset
- Executed SQL queries on mock `orders` table:
  - Filtering, aggregation, grouping, sorting
- Daily GitHub commit + written reflection

---

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Revised:
- Threads share memory; processes donâ€™t.
- Context switching is faster for threads.
- Python DataFrame filtering via boolean indexing (`df[df[col] == val]`)
- SQL: `SUM()`, `DISTINCT`, `GROUP BY`, `LIMIT`, `WHERE`

## ðŸ’¬ Reflection (Day 1)
> Iâ€™ve started strong with DSA, Python, SQL, and CS revision. Now that my base is set, I aim to gradually build real-world projects and polish communication and GitHub hygiene.
