## 📅 Day-wise Progress

### Day 1
✅ Java DSA (3 problems), OS (Processes vs Threads), Python (filtering, grouping), SQL queries  
🧠 Key concepts: boolean indexing (Python Pandas), memory sharing in threads, SQL grouping  
📝 [Full Reflection](./Reflection-Notes/Day1.md)

---

### Day 2
✅ Java DSA (Sliding Window), DBMS (Indexing), Python (Data Cleaning with Pandas), Basic SQL with indexing  
🧠 Key concepts: indexing trade-offs, data cleaning for reliable analysis, SQL indexing  
📝 [Full Reflection](./Reflection-Notes/Day2.md)

### Day 3
✅ Java DSA (Two Pointers – 3 problems), CN (OSI Model), Python (CSV Handling with Pandas)  
🧠 Key concepts: two pointers for sorted arrays/strings, OSI layers & responsibilities, filtering & exporting CSV data with Pandas  
📝 [Full Reflection](./Reflection-Notes/Day3.md)

---

### Day 4
✅ Java DSA (Two Pointers - Medium level Problem), OS (CPU Scheduling Algorithms) 
🧠 Key concepts: Learned how two pointers work in a given array, things to take care while designing a CPU scheduling algorithm, different CPU scheduling algorithms.
