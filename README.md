🧠 Key concepts: boolean indexing (Python Pandas), memory sharing in threads, SQL grouping  
📝 [Full Reflection](./Reflection-Notes/Day1.md)

---

### Day 2
✅ Java DSA (Sliding Window), DBMS (Indexing), Python (Data Cleaning with Pandas), Basic SQL with indexing  
🧠 Key concepts: indexing trade-offs, data cleaning for reliable analysis, SQL indexing  
📝 [Full Reflection](./Reflection-Notes/Day2.md)

---

### Day 3
✅ Java DSA (Two Pointers – 3 problems), CN (OSI Model), Python (CSV Handling with Pandas)  
🧠 Key concepts: two pointers for sorted arrays/strings, OSI layers & responsibilities, filtering & exporting CSV data with Pandas  
📝 [Full Reflection](./Reflection-Notes/Day3.md)

### Day 4
✅ Java DSA (Two Pointers - Medium level Problem), OS (CPU Scheduling Algorithms)   
🧠 Key concepts: Learned how two pointers work in a given array, things to take care while designing a CPU scheduling algorithm, different CPU scheduling algorithms.   
📝 [Full Reflection](./Reflection-Notes/Day4.md)

### Day 5
✅ Java DSA (Prefix Sum, Hash Table uses), OS (Paging vs Segmentation), Python (Mini ETL Pipeline), SQL (Advanced Query for Mini Data Mart Schema)   
🧠 Key concepts: Working of Prefix Sum and Hash Map in the case of subarrays with sum equals to k problem,     
                 Logical Address to Physical Address in Segmentation,     
		 Use of agg, sort_values, rename functions in pandas, deal with encoding errors in csv files,       
		 FK constraints error handling.
