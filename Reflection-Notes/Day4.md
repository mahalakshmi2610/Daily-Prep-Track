# ‚ú® Reflection Notes ‚Äì Day 4

## DSA ‚Äì Two Pointers

**Concept:** Efficient way to process arrays or strings with two moving pointers.

- Typical medium level problems:
  - Container with most water

## üóÇÔ∏è OS - CPU Scheduling

**Purpose:** Process used by OS to decide which process to allocate next to the CPU for excecution
at a given time.

- Preemptive and Non-Premptive Scheduling
- SJF - Shortest Job First
- FCFS - First Come First Serve
- Round Robin
- Priority Scheduling

**Terminologies used:** 

- Arrival time: Time at which the process arrives at ready queue
- Completion Time: Time at which the process complete its execution
- Burst Time: Time required by the process for CPU execution
- Turn Around Time: Difference between Completion Time and Arrival Time

```
Turn Around Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time
```

- Waiting Time: Difference between turn around time and burst time

```
Waiting Time = Turn Around Time - Burst Time
```

- Response Time: Time taken in the submission of the application process until the first response is issued
