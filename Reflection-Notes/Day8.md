## âœ… Task 1: DSA â€“ Sort Characters by Frequency

**Problem:**  
â†’ [LeetCode: Sort Characters by Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/)

**What I did:**  
âœ” Built frequency map using `HashMap`  
âœ” Used `PriorityQueue` (Max Heap) to sort characters by frequency  
âœ” Constructed result using `StringBuilder`  

**What I learned:**  
- Heap-based sorting with custom comparators  
- Frequency-based problems are common in interviews  
- Debugging outputs for unordered maps/heaps

## âœ… Task 2: Core CS â€“ OS (Deadlock and Prevention Strategies)

**Learning:**

- Studied Coffmanâ€™s 4 necessary conditions for deadlocks.
- Understood 3 major strategies:
  - Prevention (e.g., no hold and wait)
  - Avoidance (e.g., Banker's Algorithm)
  - Detection & Recovery
- Connected real-world analogies like traffic gridlocks and database row locks.
- Refreshed previously learned concepts through review and storytelling.

## âœ… Task 3: Python â€“ Mini ETL Pipeline (CSV â†’ SQLite3)

**What I did:**  
- Loaded CSV with columns: id, name, amount, date  
- Validated columns  
- Inserted data into SQLite3 table  
- Printed table contents to verify insertions

**Reflection:**  
âœ” First real ETL-style hands-on task  
âœ” Understood schema matching and validation  
âœ” Got more comfortable with `sqlite3` and `pandas`

---

## âœ… Task 4: SQL â€“ GROUP BY + HAVING Practice

**What I did:**  
- Wrote query to get total amount per person  
- Used `HAVING` to filter customers with total > â‚¹3000  
- Ran queries on MySQL to simulate real SQL environment  

**Reflection:**  
âœ” Confident with GROUP BY and HAVING  
âœ” Simple, but showed real use cases like customer segmentation  
âœ” Prepared for business logic-based queries
