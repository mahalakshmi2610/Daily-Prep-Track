## ✅ Task 1: DSA – Sort Characters by Frequency

**Problem:**  
→ [LeetCode: Sort Characters by Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/)

**What I did:**  
✔ Built frequency map using `HashMap`  
✔ Used `PriorityQueue` (Max Heap) to sort characters by frequency  
✔ Constructed result using `StringBuilder`  

**What I learned:**  
- Heap-based sorting with custom comparators  
- Frequency-based problems are common in interviews  
- Debugging outputs for unordered maps/heaps

## ✅ Task 2: Core CS – OS (Deadlock and Prevention Strategies)

**Topics Studied:**  
- What is a deadlock and how it happens  
- The 4 Coffman conditions: Mutual Exclusion, Hold & Wait, No Preemption, Circular Wait  
- Prevention, avoidance, and detection strategies  
- Real-world analogies: traffic deadlock, banking, Java thread locks  

**Reflection:**  
✔ Understood how deadlocks are formed in system resources  
✔ Differentiated prevention vs avoidance  
✔ Related concepts with databases and multithreading  
✔ Interview-ready with short Q&A

## ✅ Task 3: Python – Mini ETL Pipeline (CSV → SQLite3)

**What I did:**  
- Loaded CSV with columns: id, name, amount, date  
- Validated columns  
- Inserted data into SQLite3 table  
- Printed table contents to verify insertions

**Reflection:**  
✔ First real ETL-style hands-on task  
✔ Understood schema matching and validation  
✔ Got more comfortable with `sqlite3` and `pandas`

---

## ✅ Task 4: SQL – GROUP BY + HAVING Practice

**What I did:**  
- Wrote query to get total amount per person  
- Used `HAVING` to filter customers with total > ₹3000  
- Ran queries on MySQL to simulate real SQL environment  

**Reflection:**  
✔ Confident with GROUP BY and HAVING  
✔ Simple, but showed real use cases like customer segmentation  
✔ Prepared for business logic-based queries
