ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ Reflection

Tasks Done:

âœ… Solved 3 DSA problems (Java): Reverse Array, Two Sum, Move Zeroes

âœ… Revised Processes vs Threads (OS) with examples and key differences

âœ… Wrote Python script using pandas for filtering, grouping, and datetime

âœ… Wrote and tested SQL queries (filter, sum, group, sort) on online orders

âœ… Committed code to GitHub

What I learned:

Difference between thread vs process and how context switching works

Boolean indexing in pandas

Basic SQL operations and how to work with real-world-like data

What Iâ€™ll improve tomorrow:

Practice deeper SQL joins or pandas merge

Revise another core CS concept (maybe DBMS)

Start thinking about project work (backend or UI+viz)
