# 📅 Day 1 – Reflection

## ✅ Tasks Completed
- 3 Java DSA Problems: Reverse Array, Move Zeros, Two Sum
- OS Concepts: Process vs Thread with analogy
- Python DataFrame practice on online orders
- SQL filtering, grouping, ordering
- Daily GitHub commit

## 💡 Learnings
- Threads share memory, processes don't
- Python's `df[df[col] == val]` is boolean indexing
- SQL: `GROUP BY` is used with aggregation like COUNT

## 😌 Experience
Felt confident completing all tasks. Learned to break down problems and explain OS concepts clearly. Need to review context switching in depth.

## 🔁 Plan
Revisit OS scheduling next time. Explore real-world Python datasets beyond online orders in Day 2.
