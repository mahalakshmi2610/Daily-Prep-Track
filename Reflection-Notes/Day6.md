## âœ… Task 1: DSA â€“ Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

**Problem:**  
â†’ [LeetCode: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

**What I did:**  
âœ” Solved using Boolean array (26-length) â†’ faced IndexOutOfBounds  
âœ” Refactored with HashSet (Sliding Window) â†’ âœ… Accepted  
âœ” Learned two variations of solving:  
â€ƒâ€ƒ- Array-based  
â€ƒâ€ƒ- HashSet-based (cleaner, scalable)

**What I learned:**  
- Sliding Window  
- Common trap with character arrays  
- Importance of correct array size (ASCII â†’ use 128)  
- Clean code using HashSet

## âœ… Task 2: Core CS â€“ DBMS Transactions & ACID

**Topics Studied:**
- ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability  
- Transaction states: Active, Partially Committed, Failed, Aborted, Committed, Terminated  
- Basic intro to concurrency control problems

**Reflection:**  
âœ” Concepts were a bit abstract, but got the gist  
âœ” Atomicity & Durability made good sense  
âœ” Realized why transactions are the backbone of reliable systems

## âœ… Task 3: Python â€“ Data Modeling (Superstore ETL)

**What I did:**  
- Used Superstore dataset again  
- Performed grouping & aggregation:
  - Total Sales and Profit  
  - Number of unique Orders per Customer
  - Sort values based on Total Profit in Descending order 
- Exported clean CSVs (âœ” customer_profitability.csv)

**Reflection:**  
âœ” Reinforced real-world ETL + aggregation flow  
âœ” Confidence building with pandas pipelines

## âœ… Task 4: SQL â€“ Mini Data Mart Queries

**Completed:**  
1. âœ… Most popular product by number of orders  
2. âœ… Revenue by region  
3. âœ… Average order size by customer

**Reflection:**  
âœ” Learned how to use `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `COUNT`, and subqueries for real business questions  
âœ” Practiced using realistic INSERTs and data design  
âœ” Strengthened skill in translating questions into SQL
