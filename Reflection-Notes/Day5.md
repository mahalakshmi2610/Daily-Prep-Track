#  📅 Day 5 – Reflection

---

## ✅ DSA

**Topic:** *Prefix Sum + HashMap → Subarray Sum Equals K*  
**Problem:** ✔️ Done successfully.

**Learning:**

- Understood the power of prefix sum with hashmap → very optimal compared to brute force.
- Practiced careful thinking about cumulative sum logic.
- Reinforced handling of edge cases (prefix sum exactly equal to K).

---

## ✅ Core CS — OS

**Topic:** *Paging vs Segmentation*

**Learning:**

- Revised **Paging** and **Segmentation** concepts deeply.
- Understood hybrid models: *Paged Segmentation*, *Segmented Paging* → how they improve flexibility.
- Realized that modern OS combine techniques based on workload and hardware.

## ✅ Python — ETL Mini Pipeline

**Task:** Build ETL flow on *Superstore Dataset*.

**Learning:**

- Faced and solved real-world CSV encoding issue.
- Successfully built full flow:
  - Read
  - Clean
  - Transform
  - Aggregate
  - Export
- Practiced creating **Sales After Discount** → realistic business column.
- Aggregated **per Customer**, **per Product** → simulated data mart use case.

**Confidence:**  
→ Now confident to implement basic ETL flows in Pandas.

## ✅ SQL — Mini Data Mart

**Task:** Created **4-table schema** → `customers`, `products`, `orders`, `order_items`.

**Progress:**

- Inserted realistic sample data.
- Successfully wrote first query → **Top 3 customers by total spend**.

**Learning:**

- Understood practical value of **Foreign Key constraints** → handled constraint errors properly.
- Practiced correct **insertion order** (parent first → child later).
- Practiced realistic multi-table **JOIN** thinking.

---

## 🏆 Overall Reflection

- Today’s prep was **very practical** → learned from real errors (encoding issue, FK constraint).
- **Python ETL** + **SQL schema building**.
- SQL queries required **deep understanding** → not simple SELECTs → forced true **data modeling** thinking.

## 🚀 Excited for tomorrow..
