📝 Day 5 Reflection — 2025-06-09
✅ DSA
Topic: Prefix Sum + HashMap → Subarray Sum Equals K
Problem: Done successfully.
Learning:

Understood the power of prefix sum with hashmap → very optimal compared to brute force.

Practiced careful thinking about cumulative sum logic.

Reinforced handling of edge cases (prefix sum exactly equal to K).

✅ Core CS — OS
Topic: Paging vs Segmentation
Learning:

Revised Paging and Segmentation concepts deeply.

Understood hybrid models: Paged Segmentation, Segmented Paging → how they improve flexibility.

Realized that modern OS combine techniques based on workload and hardware.

✅ Python — ETL Mini Pipeline
Task: Build ETL flow on Superstore Dataset.
Learning:

Faced and solved real-world CSV encoding issue.

Successfully built full flow: read → clean → transform → aggregate → export.

Practiced creating Sales After Discount → realistic business column.

Aggregated per customer, per product → simulated data mart use case.

Confidence:
→ Now confident to implement basic ETL flows in Pandas.

✅ SQL — Mini Data Mart
Task: Created 4 table schema (customers, products, orders, order_items).
Progress:

Inserted realistic sample data.

Successfully wrote first query → Top 3 customers by total spend.

Learning:

Understood practical value of foreign key constraints → handled constraint errors properly.

Practiced proper insertion order (parent first → child later).

Practiced realistic multi-table JOIN thinking.

🏆 Overall Reflection
Today’s prep was very practical → learned from real errors (encoding, FK constraint).

Python ETL + SQL schema building.

SQL queries required deep understanding → not simple SELECTs → forces true data modeling thinking.

🚀 Excited for Day 6...
